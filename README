Introduction
============

ABIEM (Another Boundary Integral Equations Method) is a prototype
program built for the two methods of the solution of 3-D Helmholtz BIE
on smooth sufaces. These methods are described

and [here](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~dzorin/papers/ying2006h3b.pdf).

Installation Instructions
